iOS 14.5 WebKit/Safari based Jailbreak
Made by RPwnage & the Manticore team

# 📜 Information

Current Exploit is only for iOS 14.5+ as it exploits a vulnerability in audioworklet, currently there is no kernel exploit for 14.4+ yet (however, there are multiple kernel vulnerabilities that may be usable, there just aren't exploits for them yet) this won't work until an exploit is written for one of those vulnerabilities, or he adds a safari webkit exploit for 14.4.2 and lower, which will make it work on 14.3 and lower which currently have cicuta_virosa.
